"Email Sending via Mailchimp, SendGrid, and SMTP with Log Entries and Sent Mail Count

The task involves developing a system to send emails using different domains such as SMTP, Mailchimp, and SendGrid. The system will store the count of the number of emails sent through each domain. Additionally, the system will provide options to add email recipients and display logs of sent emails, including the domain, recipient email addresses, and timestamps.
                                                                                                                                                                            
Key Features:

Email Sending: Users can select the desired domain (SMTP, Mailchimp, or SendGrid) to send emails. 

The system will handle the email delivery process using the selected domain.

Sent Mail Count: The system will keep track of the total count of sent emails for each domain. This count will be updated each time an email is successfully sent.

Adding Email Recipients: Users can add email recipients by providing their email addresses. The system will store these addresses for future email sending.

Log Entries: The system will maintain a log of sent emails, recording the domain used, recipient email addresses, and timestamps. This log will provide a historical record of all sent emails.

User Interface: The user interface will provide forms to select the domain, add recipients, and initiate the email sending process. The log entries will be displayed in a table format, showing the domain, recipient email addresses, and timestamps.
